LLC partnerships have grown a lot...why?


  Advantages:
    * Limited liability status (first introduced in Wyoming 1977)
    * No double taxation (only partners taxed) 
    * More flexible memberships/participation rules than corporations
    * After 1996, uncertainty resolved about status as taxable entity
   
  Disadvantages:
    * Not allowed for banks, insurance companies
    * Can't be publicly traded like corporations
    * If using venture capital, tax exempt investors still pay 
      unrelated business income tax (UBIT)
    * Can't have tax qualified incentive stock option plans or
      similar equity compensation plans
