Goals of the paper:
   (1) Estimate average federal tax rates on different business income
   (2) Estimate tax rates/tax revenues under 1980 composition of firms

Relevant statistics:
   (1) Figure 1, p. 92
       1980 vs 2012 composition of business income (C,S,SP,P)
       1980: C= 80%, SP= 20%
       post TRA86: growth in S,P, shrinking C,SP
       2012: C= 50%, SP= 10%, S= 15%, P= 25% roughly
  
   (2) Tax forms filed
       C:  1120 for corporate income, owners' form for distributions
       S:  1120S, Schedule K-1 (owners are individuals) 
       SP: 1040, Schedule C
       P:  1065, Schedule K-1 (owners can be individuals, C-corps, S-corps,
           foreigners, tax-exempt, estates, trusts, partnerships)

   (3) Info on partnerships:
       (a) most income goes to individuals (32%) and other partnerships (26%)
       (b) 80% of income is in finance (incl. holding co) and prof services
       (c) 75% is in top 1% AGI 
       (d) most "opaque" for IRS: 30% of income was problematic
           (i) 20% not traceable to ultimate owner
          (ii) 10% had "circular" pattern with a circle of partners
               shifting income around in a circle

   (4) Answer to their question of average federal tax rates
       C:  31.6%
       S:  25.0%
       SP: 13.6%
       P:  15.9%
       Under 1980 composition, crude estimate is 100 billion more revenue 
       in 2011

   (5) Some comments
       (a) Marginal tax rates are the relevant measure, so hard to assess
           any counterfactuals
       (b) It is not clear having the administrative data was better
           than what is available to the public
