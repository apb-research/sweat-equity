I want to think about predictable implications of theory
for small business financial accounts.

Consider 2 businesses A and B  (with 1 owner in each case)
and the following technologies

  (A)  Y = F(KT,L),  KT=structures or equipment, L=labor

        (Think: corner grocery store)


  (B)  Y = G(KT1,KI,L1) = consumer services
        XI = H(KT2,KI,L2) = new intangible
        KT1+KT2 = structures or equipment
        L1+L2 = total labor
        KI = intangible capital (e.g., customer list, software, etc.)
      
        (Think: consulting firm)


Q1:  What form of organization is best for A? for B?
Q2:  How would A choose compensation for L? B for L1, and L2?
Q3:  Would we expect to see different patterns in financial accounts,
        e.g., when looking at compensation, sales, profits
