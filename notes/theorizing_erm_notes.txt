I want to think about predictable implications of theory
for small business financial accounts.

Consider 2 businesses A and B  (with 1 owner in each case)
and the following technologies

  (A)  Y = F(KT,L),  KT=structures or equipment, L=labor

        (Think: corner grocery store)


  (B)  Y = G(KT1,KI,L1) = consumer services
        XI = H(KT2,KI,L2) = new intangible
        KT1+KT2 = structures or equipment
        L1+L2 = total labor
        KI = intangible capital (e.g., customer list, software, etc.)
      
        (Think: consulting firm)


Q1:  What form of organization is best for A? for B?
Q2:  How would A choose compensation for L? B for L1, and L2?
Q3:  Would we expect to see different patterns in financial accounts,
        e.g., when looking at compensation, sales, profits




Consider simpler case for consultant:

    Y         = G(KT,KI,L1)
    XI        = H(L2)

    Meas Comp = W*L1 (or even lower)
    Meas Prof = P*Y-W*L1-deltaT*P*KT
    Meas ROA  = (P*Y-W*L1)/(P*KT) - deltaT
              = (rT*KT+rI*KI+W*L2)/(P*KT) - deltaT
              = i + (rI*KI+W*L2)/(P*KT)  > i,  where i=rT-deltaT
   
    Econ comp = W*L
    Econ prof = P*Y+Q*XI - W*L - deltaT*KT+ deltaI*KI
    ROA_T     = (P*Y-W*L1-deltaT*P*KT)/(P*KT) = rT-deltaT = i
    ROA_I     = (Q*XI-W*L2-deltaI*Q*KI)/(Q*KI) = rI-deltaI = i
